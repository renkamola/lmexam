2 file folders are provided for this coding exam.

- development: contains the PSD file, and font if needed
- preview: contains the mockups for the template and the elements

Your task is to create an html file using the available resources given in the PSD file.

Your code should make use of the latest available coding techniques and technologies that you are capable of applying.

We would expect you will be using HTML, CSS and Javascript for this template. You may use any library you want to utilize

Make sure that the output files are all static (.html, .css and .js files) and must not be server-side dependent (not php or any other server-side language).

You may use preprocessors(optional) that compiles your source code into .html (e.g. pug, jade, haml), .css (sass, scss, less, stylus), and .js (browserify, coffee, babel and on).

The test should not exceed 8 hours. If incase you won't be able to finish the task in 8 hours time, please submit whatever output you have.

Before starting the test, create a repository in GitHub. Create your account if you don't have one yet. Do not commit anything yet.

Create a file called my.log

When you are ready to begin coding, please push my.log file with a text "IN" in it as your initial commit and a commit message "IN". This will indicate your start time. 
And when you take a break push the my.log file with a text and a commit message "BREAK", "BACK" when you resume and "OUT" when you finish. 
Pushing development files excluding my.log file should be done the usual way.

Functionalities:
- For the input field, provide a dummy data so we can test it using 00000 zipcode as seen on preview/screen1-1.png.
- Modal shown on screen3.png will appear upon selecting a category shown on screen2.png (use the same dummy data for all categories)
- Nothing will happen when clicking on "Find a Lawyer Now"
- Clicking on "Read Review" will show a modal. screen4.png
- When clicking on "click here" on "Can't find a category?" the other categories modal will show. screen5.png

Main Requirements:
- Base Template should be complete within 8hrs.
- Follow the exact fonts and colors used in the mockup.
- All elements, modals, links should be functional and contains dummy data, if provided in the preview, please use it. Otherwise please make up something for it.

Optional Requirements: (Additional points will be considered if this is included)
- Template should be responsive and viewable in Tablet and Desktop. No Mobile view for now. If you want to apply a mobile view for it please do so if you have time.

You will need to provide us the GitHub URL so we could clone your repository for review.

Note: 

- You will be responsible for extracting the graphics or assets needed for your template from the PSD.

Criteria for evaluating your output:

- Quality of the source code over the time it took to finish the exam: 20%
- Element Positioning: 10%
- Styling: 25%
- Markup: 10%
- Functionality: 35%

Good Luck!
